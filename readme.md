The company provided us a data set containing data regarding the sales of dif- ferent products. More in detail we know the sku (unique identifier), the pack type (single or multi pack), the size in grams, the brand (there are five differ- ent brands), the price, the position exposed the previous week, the % of volume in promo of the previous week and the sales of the previous week of each product. 

The total number of distinct products is 43, but the target prediction will be designated only to 12 products (in the scope). 

The data set is divided between training and testing. 

The data are collected with a weekly frequency starting from the 10th of De- cember 2016 to the 22nd of June 2019 for the training set and 29th of June 2019 to the 14th of December 2019 for the test set. 

The task assigned is to forecast the target sales of the 12 products in the scope for the next 25 weeks, from 29th June 2019 to 14th December 2019. 

The performances of each model in our analysis are evaluated by means of the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) metric on the test set.
